# Blackjack-c

### Blackjack C is a C-based program game where players can play the popular gambling game called **Blackjack**.

It is recommended that the player has a basic understanding of how to play Blackjack prior to playing the game; however, newbies are also given the option to view the basics of how to play Blackjack through the main menu's navigation 'HOW TO PLAY' option.

To select a choice, enter a number corresponding to the desired decision seen in the console and press enter to finalize your decision.

**NOTE:** It is possible to choose multiple decisions in one line, so do not type digits larger than 9 unless you want to chain-select options.

An example would be if I was in the table selection menu and typed in **65**. The result would be that it would automatically return me to the main menu, then select option 5 from the main menu (which would be to exit the game).

**The game features:**
- 🔢Split betting ---> Splitting your hand (if they are a matching pair) into two different hands as your first decision
- 💸Pair betting ---> Bet that the hand you will be dealt will be a matching pair (11:1 payout!)
- ⚕️Insurance betting ---> If the dealer is dealt a face-up Ace card, you can make an insurance bet that bets the dealer was dealt a blackjack (2:1 payout)
- 🪙Double (or Double-down betting) ---> Hit your hand with only one card and double your current main bet
- 🏳️Surrender ---> Don't like your hand? Surrender your hand for a 50% refund!
- 💰Table Tiers ---> Advance your way into higher tier tables that allow for higher bets! Currently 5 different table tiers
- More features to be added! 💯
